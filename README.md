About me:

Hey!

I'm just starting out in the world of programming. I currently learning to code in C# and in September this year I start a new study Software Development at the 
Hogeschool Utrecht, where i will use a lot of C# Java and Python. And besides the languages I will learn among other things, to work with tools like DevOps and working
together in Agile.

I realized not long ago that programming is right up my ally and I started enjoying it very much. After researching all the different programming languages I landed on C#. 
I see a lot of possibilities and potential when knowing how to code in C#.

Besides my new found interest and future. I love to make and record music as a hobby. I like to be creative, and i'm convinced that a creative mind helps solving problems 
and that it lets you think outside the box.
