About me:

Hey!

I'm a student at the Hogeschool Utrecht where I'm currently studying Software Development. I started coding in C# and Java, and i will learn a lot more in the upcoming years of my study.

I realized not long ago that programming is right up my ally and I started enjoying it very much. After researching all the different programming languages I landed on C#. 
I see a lot of possibilities and potential when knowing how to code in C#.

Besides my new found interest and future. I love to make and record music as a hobby. I like to be creative, and i'm convinced that a creative mind helps solving problems 
and that it lets you think outside the box.
