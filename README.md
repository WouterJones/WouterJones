About me:

Hey!

I'm a student at the Hogeschool Utrecht where I'm currently studying Software Development. 

I realized not long ago that programming is right up my ally and I started enjoying it very much. After researching a lot of the different programming languages I landed on C#. Through my current study im exploring more and more. I see a lot of possibilities and potential when knowing how to code. If you can think of it, you can make it! 

The current stack im learning through my study is Java with the springbooth framework, html, css, javascript with react, node.js and a bit of bootstrap.

Besides my new found interest and future. I love to make and record music as a hobby. I like to be creative, and I'm convinced that a creative mind helps solving problems and that it let you think outside the box.
